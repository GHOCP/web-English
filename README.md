# web-English
This is a crude website of my English lexical collection as model tool to learn a language, which is built from silly HTML, CSS, and vanilla 
JavaScript. Pardon my lack of knowledge in advanced modern web developing. Hopefully a brand new one will come out right after I have time to
aquire wiser web building methods.
